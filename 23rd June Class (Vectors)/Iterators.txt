// Iterators
/*
- Similar to Pointers
- Used to access members of the container classes
- Each of the container classes is associated with a type of iterator.

- Diffrent Types :
                    1. Input Iterators
                    2. Output Iterators
                    3. Forward Iterators
                    4. Bidirectional Iterators
                    5. Random - access Iterators

Input_iterators           - Read Values with Forward Movement
Output_iterators          - Write Values with Forward Movement
Forward_iterators         - Read and Write Values with Forward Movement
Bidirectional_iterators   - Read and Write Values with Forward and Backward Movement
Random_iterators          - Read and Write Values with random access.
reverse_itreator          - Eiter a randon iterator or a Bidirectional Iterators that

Operaton on Iterators:

*              -

->             -

++             -

== and !=      -

=              -
